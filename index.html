        <h1>The Solar System</h1>
        <p>
            Our solar system consists of many celestial objects that orbit around the Sun, a star that makes up over 98% of the solar system's mass. These objects include planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. To our knowledge, our solar system is the only one in the universe that has produced living organisms, all of which are located on Earth.

        <h2>Planets</h2>
        <p>
            There are eight full-sized planets in the solar system, including four rocky planets and four gaseous planet. The rocky planets are smaller and closer to the Sun, while the gas giants are much more massive and located farther away. Below is a table of all eight planets, their type, and their distance from the Sun.
