        <h1>The Solar System</h1>
        <p>
            Our solar system consists of many celestial objects that orbit the Sun, a star that makes up over 98% of the solar system's mass. These objects include planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids and comets. To our knowledge, our solar system is the only one in the universe that has produced living organisms, all of which are located on Earth.

        <h2>Planets</h2>
        <p>
            There are eight full-sized planets in the solar system, including four rocky planets and four gaseous planet. The rocky planets are smaller and closer to the Sun, while the gas giants are much more massive and located farther away. Below is a table of all eight planets, their type, and their distance from the Sun.

        <h2>Dwarf planets</h2>
        <p>
            Dwarf planets are objects that orbit the Sun, much like regular planets. The only difference is that dwarf planets are not massive enough to clear other objects out of their orbital path. The most famous dwarf planet is Pluto, which was considered a planet by astronomers until 2006.
        </p>
        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>
            Moons are rocky objects that orbit planets and dwarf planets. Some planets, like Mercury and Venus, have zero moons, while others, like Jupiter and Saturn, have over 50 confirmed moons. Earth only has one moon, but it is the largest moon in the solar system in proportion to the size of its planet.
        </p>
        <h2>Comets and Asteroids</h2>
        <p>
            Comets and asteroids are both small objects that orbit the Sun. The main difference between the two is that asteroids are made of metal and rocky material, while comets are made of ice and dust. Comets are visibly different because they appear to have "tails", which are evaporated gas and dust that are escaping a comet as it moves.
